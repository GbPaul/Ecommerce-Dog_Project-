# Ecommerce-Dog_Project-
This is my response to a front-end coding challenge from Udemy

The purpose of the project is to design and practice CSS3, HTML5, and Bootstrap Skills with responsive design.  
The homepage is completed but left with contact, pricing and download link. 

Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
